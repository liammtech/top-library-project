Two versions of the script have been developed:

- First is an ordinary, spaghetti-code blast at getting the app to work
- Second is a modular re-factoring, after going through the TOP "modular pattern material

Start of script @ 17.28
End of script @ 17.57
One-screen @ 5.39

May try implementing third version using jQuery at a later date
